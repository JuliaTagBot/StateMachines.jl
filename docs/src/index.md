# StateMachines.jl

a framework for state machines in Julia. It will support:

- hierarchical state machines (HSM) as described by [UML statecharts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_state_machine),
- but also [precursor state diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram) like Harel statecharts or Moore and Mealy machines

It then will be useful for 
- discrete event simulation of communication or queueing systems where events to state machines are generated by a simulation engine,
- implementation of reactive system with user generated or external events.

## Installation
